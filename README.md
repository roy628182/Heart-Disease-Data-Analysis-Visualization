# Heart-Disease-Data-Analysis-Visualization
Exploring and visualizing Heart Disease data using EDA techniques, uncovering insights into disease patterns and correlations.

Overview:
        This repository presents a comprehensive EDA of Heart Disease data, leveraging visualization and statistical techniques to uncover hidden patterns and correlations. The dataset includes various attributes such as patient demographics, medical history, and test results.

Visualizations:
- Distribution of patient ages and sexes (histograms, bar plots)
- Correlation between risk factors (heatmaps, scatter plots)
- Disease prevalence by demographic groups (bar plots, pie charts)
- Feature importance for disease prediction (feature selection plots)

Analysis:
- Univariate and multivariate analysis of risk factors
- Correlation and feature selection analysis
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Data:
- Heart Disease dataset

Libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
